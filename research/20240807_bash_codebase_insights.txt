By going through the echo.def and its associated Header files:

- Builtins are written in .def files.
	advantage: Modular codebase. By different compiler Flags and defines one can specify if a particular codesnippet is included in the final executable.
- Command structure and linkedlist as a carrier of the prompt.
	- List as the upper struct.
		Structure:
		/* A structure which represents a word. */
		typedef struct word_desc {
		  char *word;		/* Zero terminated string. */
		  int flags;		/* Flags associated with this word. */
		} WORD_DESC;

		/* A linked list of words. */
		typedef struct word_list {
		  struct word_list *next;
		  WORD_DESC *word;
		} WORD_LIST;
