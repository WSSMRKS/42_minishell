Is the bash implementation also using a symbol table to store the variables of the current shell session?
	Yes, the Bash shell uses a symbol table (also known as a hash table or associative array) to store the variables of the current shell session. This table is used to efficiently manage and access the shell variables, both environment variables and shell variables (local variables).

	### How It Works:

	1. **Variable Storage in Bash:**
	- Each variable in Bash (whether it's a local variable, a shell variable, or an environment variable) is stored as an entry in the shell's internal symbol table.
	- The symbol table maps variable names (keys) to their corresponding values (data).
	- When you reference a variable in a Bash script or shell session, the shell looks up the variable name in this symbol table to retrieve its value.

	2. **Environment Variables vs. Shell Variables:**
	- **Shell Variables:** These are variables that are local to the shell. They are not inherited by child processes unless explicitly exported.
	- **Environment Variables:** These are variables that are inherited by child processes. When you use the `export` command, the shell marks the variable in the symbol table as an environment variable, making it available to any subprocesses started from the current shell.

	3. **Efficiency:**
	- Bash uses a hash table (a type of symbol table) because it allows for quick lookup, insertion, and deletion of variables. This is especially important in a shell, where variable access needs to be fast and efficient.
	- The hash table implementation allows Bash to handle a large number of variables without significant performance degradation.

	4. **Interaction with Commands:**
	- When you assign a value to a variable in Bash (e.g., `VAR=value`), the shell creates or updates an entry in the symbol table.
	- When you export a variable (e.g., `export VAR`), the shell updates the symbol table entry to indicate that the variable should be included in the environment of any spawned child processes.
	- When you unset a variable (e.g., `unset VAR`), the shell removes the entry from the symbol table.

	### Example:

	Consider the following Bash commands:


	```bash
	MY_VAR="Hello"   # Bash adds or updates MY_VAR in the symbol table
	export MY_VAR    # MY_VAR is now marked as an environment variable
	echo $MY_VAR     # Bash looks up MY_VAR in the symbol table and retrieves its value
	unset MY_VAR     # MY_VAR is removed from the symbol table
	```

	### Summary:
	Bash does indeed use a symbol table (or hash table) to store the variables of the current shell session. This data structure enables efficient management of variables, including setting, exporting, retrieving, and unsetting them. The symbol table is a key part of how Bash handles variable scope, inheritance, and performance.
