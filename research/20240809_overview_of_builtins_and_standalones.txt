Summary
	Built-in commands are part of the shell itself and do not require an external executable. These are typically related to shell control (e.g., cd, export, alias).
	Standalone programs are separate executables located in directories like /bin/, /usr/bin/, etc. These are invoked by the shell to perform various tasks (e.g., ls, grep, awk).
	The exact set of utilities available and whether they are built-ins or standalone programs can vary slightly depending on the Unix/Linux distribution and the specific shell being used.
