special cases:
 here_doc:
	when whereever in the input a "<<" is contained start the here_doc-protocol. receive the multiline-Input until EOF is detected.
	->
		- prompt containing "<<"
		- process delimiter
		- wait until input is finished containing the EOF delimiter.
		- put input to tempfile
		- process during execution.
	Example:
		maweiss@c4a12c10:~/mw/minishell/minishell_ui/ui$ cat >infile; <infile cat | grep bla | cat >outfile_cat | <<EOF cat >outfile
		> this is an interesting example of the bash priorities.
		> This is heredoc handled first
		> EOF
		This is the cat command expecting bla
		This line won't be in the output
		this one is bla
		maweiss@c4a12c10:~/mw/minishell/minishell_ui/ui$ cat outfile
		outfile      outfile_cat
		maweiss@c4a12c10:~/mw/minishell/minishell_ui/ui$ cat outfile
		this is an interesting example of the bash priorities.
		This is heredoc handled first
		maweiss@c4a12c10:~/mw/minishell/minishell_ui/ui$ cat outfile
		outfile      outfile_cat
		maweiss@c4a12c10:~/mw/minishell/minishell_ui/ui$ cat outfile_cat
		This is the cat command expecting bla
		this one is bla
		maweiss@c4a12c10:~/mw/minishell/minishell_ui/ui$
